For the current year, admissions are conducted through the **IISER Aptitude Test (IAT)**, which is a computer‑based entrance examination that candidates must appear for in order to be considered for admission to IISERs across India. ([iiserpune.ac.in][1])\r\n\r\nWho can apply for IISER admissions? Candidates who have passed their Class XII (or equivalent) examination in the science stream in the relevant years are eligible to apply. Applicants must have studied at least three subjects among Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Physics in Class XII to be eligible for the IISER Aptitude Test. Applicants can include Indian nationals, OCI/PIO card holders, and foreign nationals (foreign applicants may need to provide equivalence certificates). ([iiseradmission.in][2])\r\n\r\nWhat are the academic requirements for IISER admission? \r\nStudents must have completed Class XII (or equivalent) from a board recognised by the Council of Boards of School Education (COBSE) in India. They should have taken a science stream with subjects including Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and/or Mathematics. Minimum percentage requirements in Class XII may be specified for eligibility as detailed on the official admissions portal. ([iiseradmission.in][2])\r\n\r\nHow is the IISER Aptitude Test (IAT) conducted? \r\nThe IISER Aptitude Test is a computer‑based test administered nationally at designated centres. This test is the exclusive admission test for most IISER undergraduate programmes, with admissions determined by candidates’ performance in the IAT and their programme preferences. ([iiseradmission.in][3])\r\n\r\nWhat happens after the IAT exam? \r\nAfter the IAT is conducted, the results and scorecards are published on the official IISER admissions portal. Candidates whose scores meet the required cut‑offs and merit criteria are considered for seat allocation through the online admissions process. ([The Economic Times][4])\r\n\r\nHow does the counselling and seat allocation process work? \r\nThe entire admissions counselling process is conducted online through the IISER admissions portal. Candidates log in to the portal to check admission offers based on factors such as their IAT rank, programme preferences, category, and seat availability. Candidates can accept or reject offers before the deadline. Accepted offers require payment of a Seat Acceptance Fee (SAF). Candidates may choose to freeze (retain) a seat or float (remain eligible for higher preference seats in subsequent rounds). ([iiseradmission.in][5])\r\n\r\nIs there any interview or personal round? For standard undergraduate admissions via the IAT, there is no interview or personal round; admissions are solely based on the entrance test score, preferences, and online allocation process. ([Reddit][6])\r\n\r\nAre there other channels for IISER admission? \r\nIn the past, admission channels such as the Kishore Vaigyanik Protsahan Yojana (KVPY) and JEE Advanced scores were used for IISER admissions. However, for the most recent admissions cycle, IISER admissions are conducted exclusively through the IISER Aptitude Test for most programmes. ([iiserpune.ac.in][1])\r\n\r\nDo international students have a separate process? \r\nInternational applicants can apply through the IISER Aptitude Test or via designated international admission channels where available, and may need to provide additional documents such as equivalence certificates. ([iiseradmission.in][2])\r\n\r\nWhat programmes are offered through the IISER Admission Process? \r\nIISERs offer the five‑year BS‑MS (Dual Degree) programmes across all institutes, and some IISERs also offer four‑year BS degrees in specific disciplines such as Economics or related sciences.

Admission to the five‑year Integrated MSc programme at the National Institute of Science Education and Research (NISER), Bhubaneswar and the University of Mumbai – Department of Atomic Energy Centre for Excellence in Basic Sciences (UM‑DAE CEBS), Mumbai is through a national computer‑based test called the **National Entrance Screening Test (NEST)**. Candidates who qualify the NEST exam are ranked on a merit list, and admissions are offered strictly based on this merit list and eligibility criteria. ([Nest Exam][1])\r\n\r\nWho is eligible to appear in the NEST exam? \r\nTo be eligible for NEST, candidates should have passed or be appearing for the Class XII board examination in the science stream (with at least three subjects among Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Physics) from a recognised board. They must secure a **minimum of 60 % aggregate marks** in Class XII (55 % for SC/ST/Divyangjan categories) and must have their final results by the time of admission. There is **no upper age limit** to appear in NEST. ([Nest Exam][2])\r\n\r\nHow do I apply for the NEST exam? Candidates must fill out the **online application form** available on the official NEST website (nestexam.in), complete registration, provide all required personal and academic information, upload documents, and pay the examination fee before the deadline specified in the information brochure. ([Nest Exam][3])\r\n\r\nWhat happens after I take the NEST exam? After taking the exam, candidates receive a **scorecard** and are placed on a **merit list** based on their performance in NEST. Admission offers for the Integrated MSc programme are made from this merit list, and candidates may receive emails or notifications guiding them on how to proceed with accepting admission. ([The Times of India][4])\r\n\r\nHow is the admission offer finalised? Once a candidate is selected based on the merit list, they need to **submit an Expression of Interest (EOI)** or follow instructions given by NISER to confirm their intention to join the programme. Candidates must report in person to the NISER campus on the scheduled date for **document verification, admission confirmation, and orientation**. If they fail to report by the given deadline, their seat may be forfeited. ([NISER][5])\r\n\r\nWhat documents are required for admission at NISER? \r\nCandidates admitted to NISER must bring documents such as the printed NEST application/admission form, NEST scorecard, Aadhaar card (original and photocopy), Class 10 and 12 mark sheets and certificates, school leaving certificate, valid caste or disability certificate if applicable, and other specified documents on the day of reporting. ([NISER][5])\r\n\r\nIs there counselling similar to other exams? \r\nThe NEST process does not have a typical multi‑round counselling like some other entrance exams. Instead, candidates who qualify and are on the merit list need to respond to the **admission invitations**, submit required expressions of interest, and complete the reporting and verification process as per instructions from NISER or CEBS. ([Shiksha][6])\r\n\r\nCan I appear for NEST if I am a dropper or older candidate? \r\nYes, there is **no age limit** for appearing in the NEST exam or for admission to the Integrated MSc programme at NISER or CEBS, provided you meet the other eligibility criteria such as passing Class XII in the required years and securing the minimum aggregate marks.
